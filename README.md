# DINE-LINE
Dine Line is a representation of a website that allows MIT students to eat efficiently while reducing COVID transmission. Our website features a Google Map with markers and popups indicating where dining halls are located. Our simple and intuitive interface allows students to easily choose where to eat based on current populations and location.
